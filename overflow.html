                Blakeney Chapel is a ruined building on the Norfolk 
                coast of England. Despite its name, it is in the parish of 
                Cley next the Sea, not the adjoining village of Blakeney, 
                and was probably not a chapel. The building stood on a 
                mound or "eye" (pictured) on the seaward end of the coastal 
                marshes, less than 200 m (220 yd) from the sea and just 
                north of the current channel of the River Glaven where it 
                turns to run parallel to the shoreline. It consisted of two 
                rectangular rooms of unequal size, and appears to be intact 
                in a 1586 map. Only the foundations and part of a wall still 
                remain. A small hearth, probably used for smelting iron, 
                is the only evidence of a specific activity. Much of the 
                structural material was reused in nearby buildings long ago. 
                The ruins are protected as a scheduled monument and 
                Grade II listed building due to their historical importance, 
                but are not actively managed. A realignment of the 
                Glaven's course through the marshes accelerated the 
                ruins' likely loss to the sea.
