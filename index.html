                Welcome to Adam's Git Experimentation page
            </h1>

            <p>Adam has ingeniously set up this page to record the proper formats of common HTML elements and to experiment with them. He really is quite smart</p>

            <p>The heading and these two sentences are placed inside a header element</p>

            <p>All of the text in this header section should appear dark slate blue, as it is styled using the CSS child selector method</p>

        </header>

        <nav>

            <p>This is a nav element, which contains the links to the pages of HTML elements</p>

            <p>These are anchor elements, which are hyperlinks to other pages. These are links to internal pages, so the browser tab will display that page</p>

            <p>The hyperlinks should be in white text on an orange-red background, since a style rule with the CSS sibling selector method has been applied</p>

                <h1>Babel Fish</h1>

                <p>
                    This is an example of how article, section, header and footer elements interact with each other
                </p>

              </header>

              <section aria-labelledby="babel-fish-one babel-fish-two babel-fish-three" class="babel-fish">

                <p id="babel-fish-one" class="babel-fish">
                  The Babel Fish is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this 
                  brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought 
                  frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them
                </p>

                <p id="babel-fish-two" class="babel-fish">
                  The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language.
                </p>

                <p id="babel-fish-three" class="babel-fish">
                  The Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, 
                  has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.

                <p>
                    The octopus (plural octopuses) is a soft-bodied, eight-limbed mollusc of the order Octopoda.
                </p>

                <aside>
                    <p>
                      Octopuses defend themselves against predators using the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, the ability to jet quickly through the water and hide, and even deceit.
                    </p>
                </aside>

                <p>
                    Octopuses inhabit various regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow quickly, mature early, and are short-lived.
                </p>

                <p>This is an example of an aside element. The first and third paragraphs are providing a generic high-level overview of octopuses. 
                    The second paragraph digresses into discussing how octopuses defend themselves
                </p>

                <p>
                  The first and third paragraphs plus this one should appear red. The second paragraph, the aside, should be blue. 
                  This is because two CSS rules with the Descendent Selector method have been applied
                </p>
