                This is a paragraph within a div. The text is red because a CSS rule styles the parent div and the paragraph inherits the color property
                The border is defined in the same style rule, but is not inherited by the paragraph because borders are not inherited by default
            </p>

                This is a paragraph within a second div. The text is blue because a CSS styles the parent div and the paragraph inherits the color property
                The paragraph also has a border because the border is defined in the same style rule and a second style rule that targets the paragraph
                has been set to inherit the border styling
